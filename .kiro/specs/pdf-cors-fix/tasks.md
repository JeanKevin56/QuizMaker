# PDF CORS Fix Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create Vite plugin to copy PDF.js worker files





  - Write custom Vite plugin that copies PDF.js worker files from node_modules to dist/assets/pdf/ during build
  - Ensure plugin handles both development and production builds appropriately
  - Add error handling for missing source files
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 2. Update Vite configuration to include PDF worker plugin





  - Integrate the new PDF.js worker copy plugin into vite.config.js
  - Configure plugin to run during the generateBundle phase
  - Test that worker files are correctly copied to the output directory
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3_

- [x] 3. Enhance PDFProcessor service with local worker path detection





  - Modify configureWorker() function to detect and use local worker files in production
  - Implement detectWorkerPath() method that returns appropriate worker path based on environment
  - Update worker source priority: local files first, then CDN fallbacks
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3_

- [ ] 4. Implement robust fallback chain for worker initialization
  - Update initializeWorker() method to try local worker files first in production
  - Add retry logic that attempts multiple worker sources before falling back to sync processing
  - Implement proper error detection for CORS vs other worker loading failures
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 3.2_

- [ ] 5. Add enhanced error handling and user feedback
  - Create specific error messages for CORS-related failures
  - Implement user notifications when falling back to synchronous processing
  - Add progress indicators that differentiate between worker and sync processing modes
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.4_

- [ ] 6. Update build optimization script to verify PDF worker files
  - Modify scripts/build-optimize-simple.js to check for PDF worker file presence
  - Add validation that worker files are accessible and properly sized
  - Include worker file verification in build process logging
  - _Requirements: 2.4_

- [ ] 7. Implement chunked processing for synchronous fallback mode
  - Add chunked processing capability to prevent UI blocking during large PDF processing
  - Implement progress callbacks for real-time user feedback during sync processing
  - Add cancellation support for long-running PDF operations
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.5_

- [ ] 8. Create comprehensive tests for worker loading and fallback scenarios
  - Write unit tests for worker path detection logic
  - Create integration tests that simulate CORS failures and verify fallback behavior
  - Add tests for chunked processing and progress reporting
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 9. Update deployment configuration and documentation
  - Update deployment scripts to ensure worker files are included in production builds
  - Document the new worker loading strategy and fallback mechanisms
  - Create troubleshooting guide for PDF processing issues
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.3_

- [ ] 10. Test end-to-end PDF processing in production environment
  - Deploy changes to staging environment and verify PDF upload works without CORS errors
  - Test fallback scenarios by temporarily blocking worker loading
  - Validate user experience with both worker and synchronous processing modes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 3.4_
