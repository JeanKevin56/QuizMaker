# PDF CORS Fix Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issue that prevents PDF upload functionality from working on the deployed site. The current error "Access to script at 'https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist@4.0.379/build/pdf.worker.min.js' from origin 'https://jeankevin56.github.io' has been blocked by CORS policy" prevents users from uploading and processing PDF files for quiz generation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: PDF Worker Self-Hosting

**User Story:** As a user visiting the deployed site, I want to upload PDF files for quiz generation, so that I can create quizzes from my existing documents without CORS errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload a PDF file on the deployed site THEN the system SHALL process it without CORS errors
2. WHEN the PDF processing starts THEN the system SHALL use locally hosted PDF.js worker files instead of external CDNs
3. WHEN the PDF worker is loaded THEN it SHALL be served from the same origin as the application
4. WHEN PDF processing completes THEN the extracted text SHALL be available for quiz generation
5. IF the local worker fails to load THEN the system SHALL fall back to synchronous processing without workers

### Requirement 2: Build Process Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the PDF.js worker files to be automatically included in the build process, so that they are available in production deployments without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL copy PDF.js worker files to the output directory
2. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL automatically detect and use the local worker files
3. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN the worker files SHALL be correctly referenced
4. WHEN the build completes THEN the worker files SHALL be optimized and minified appropriately
5. IF worker files are missing THEN the build process SHALL warn about potential PDF processing issues

### Requirement 3: Fallback and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when PDF processing encounters issues, so that I understand what's happening and have alternative options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PDF worker loading fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message explaining the issue
2. WHEN CORS errors occur THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt fallback processing methods
3. WHEN PDF processing is unavailable THEN the system SHALL suggest using the text input option instead
4. WHEN processing falls back to synchronous mode THEN the user SHALL be informed about potentially slower performance
5. IF all PDF processing methods fail THEN the system SHALL provide helpful troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 4: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want PDF processing to be as fast as possible while maintaining reliability, so that I can quickly generate quizzes from my documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PDF worker is available THEN the system SHALL use asynchronous processing for better performance
2. WHEN processing large PDFs THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators to keep users informed
3. WHEN using fallback synchronous processing THEN the system SHALL process files in chunks to prevent UI blocking
4. WHEN PDF processing completes THEN the system SHALL cache worker initialization for subsequent uploads
5. IF processing takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide options to cancel and try alternatives
