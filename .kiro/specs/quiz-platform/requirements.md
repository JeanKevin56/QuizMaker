# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a web-based quiz platform designed for educational purposes. The platform will allow users to take customizable quizzes with various question types, view detailed results with AI-generated explanations, and create/manage quizzes either manually or through AI-powered generation from study materials (PDFs or text). The platform is intended to be deployable on GitHub Pages or similar static hosting services.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student, I want to take quizzes with different question types, so that I can test my knowledge in various formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a quiz THEN the system SHALL display questions sequentially with appropriate input controls
2. WHEN a user encounters a multiple choice question THEN the system SHALL allow selection of one or multiple answers based on question configuration
3. WHEN a user encounters a text input question THEN the system SHALL provide a text field for entering specific values
4. WHEN a user completes all questions THEN the system SHALL calculate and display their score
5. WHEN a user views results THEN the system SHALL show their answer, correct answer, and AI-generated explanation for each question

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an educator, I want to create and customize quizzes manually, so that I can design assessments tailored to my curriculum.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the quiz creation interface THEN the system SHALL provide tools to add, edit, and delete questions
2. WHEN a user creates a question THEN the system SHALL allow selection of question type (multiple choice single, multiple choice multiple, text input)
3. WHEN a user adds media THEN the system SHALL support image uploads and display them within questions
4. WHEN a user configures a multiple choice question THEN the system SHALL allow adding/removing answer options and marking correct answers
5. WHEN a user saves a quiz THEN the system SHALL store all quiz data and make it available for taking

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student, I want to automatically generate quizzes from my study materials using free AI services, so that I can quickly create practice tests without cost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a PDF document THEN the system SHALL extract text content using client-side PDF processing (PDF.js) or free PDF extraction APIs
2. WHEN a user provides a large text chunk THEN the system SHALL accept and process the content for quiz generation
3. WHEN the AI processes study material THEN the system SHALL use free LLM APIs (such as Google Gemini free tier) to generate diverse question types
4. WHEN quiz generation is complete THEN the system SHALL create a fully functional quiz with questions, answers, and explanations
5. WHEN the AI generates questions THEN the system SHALL ensure questions are relevant, accurate, and educationally valuable within free API rate limits

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the platform to work reliably in web browsers, so that I can access it from any device without installation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the platform THEN the system SHALL load and function in modern web browsers
2. WHEN the platform is deployed THEN the system SHALL be compatible with static hosting services like GitHub Pages
3. WHEN a user interacts with the interface THEN the system SHALL provide responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
4. WHEN data needs to be persisted THEN the system SHALL use client-side storage mechanisms
5. WHEN the platform loads THEN the system SHALL provide a clean, intuitive user interface

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my quizzes and results, so that I can track my progress and reuse assessments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates multiple quizzes THEN the system SHALL provide a dashboard to view and manage all quizzes
2. WHEN a user completes a quiz THEN the system SHALL save the results for future reference
3. WHEN a user wants to retake a quiz THEN the system SHALL allow multiple attempts while preserving result history
4. WHEN a user wants to edit a quiz THEN the system SHALL provide modification capabilities for existing quizzes
5. WHEN a user wants to delete a quiz THEN the system SHALL remove the quiz and associated data with confirmation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want AI-powered features using free APIs to enhance my learning experience, so that I can get detailed feedback and explanations without cost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a question incorrectly THEN the system SHALL generate contextual explanations using free LLM APIs (Google Gemini free tier)
2. WHEN the AI generates quiz content THEN the system SHALL use well-designed prompts optimized for free API rate limits
3. WHEN AI processes study materials THEN the system SHALL identify key concepts and create relevant questions within free tier constraints
4. WHEN AI generates explanations THEN the system SHALL provide clear, educational feedback that helps understanding
5. WHEN the system uses AI services THEN the system SHALL handle API rate limits, errors gracefully and provide fallback options

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious student, I want the platform to operate within free API limits, so that I can use all features without incurring charges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system makes API calls THEN it SHALL respect free tier rate limits and quotas
2. WHEN API limits are approached THEN the system SHALL notify users and suggest alternatives
3. WHEN possible THEN the system SHALL use client-side processing to minimize API usage
4. WHEN API keys are required THEN the system SHALL allow users to input their own free API keys
5. WHEN free alternatives exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize them over paid services
