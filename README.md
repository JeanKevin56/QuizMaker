## Deployment

### Quick Deploy to GitHub Pages

The easiest way to deploy is using the automated GitHub Actions workflow:

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Update configuration** in `deploy.config.js`:
   ```javascript
   githubPages: {
     repoName: 'your-repo-name',
     username: 'your-github-username'
   }
   ```
3. **Enable GitHub Pages** in repository Settings â†’ Pages â†’ Source: "GitHub Actions"
4. **Push to main branch** - deployment happens automatically!

Your site will be available at: `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name`

### Manual Deployment
